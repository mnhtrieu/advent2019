# Advent of Code 2019
This repository is dedicated to the AoC 2019 puzzles. Every puzzle will be written in C++. 

## What is Advent of Code?
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

The AoC was created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl)

Each puzzle consists of two parts. On successfully solving the first part, the second part unlocks and usually it is just a modification of the first part. In every folder, there should be an input for the puzzle except for the 4th day, which didn't necessarily need an input.
